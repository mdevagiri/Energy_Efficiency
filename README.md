# Energy-Efficiency
Sustainability has become a crucial factor for the construction of the new buildings and sometimes it can be challenge. However, recent technological advancements construction industry allows integration of energy saving techniques seamlessly into house designs. While these energy-efficient features are expensive, one can incorporate the traditional energy efficiency techniques into the building design using engineering and Architectural techniques. For assisting the Engineering and architectural Designers the model proposed in this project helps in predicting the heating and cooling load of a residential building using historical data and different Machine Learning Algorithms. And the model is deployed on Heroku using Flask. 

# Purpose
The solution proposed here is to implemented a number of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyse the strength of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order to discover the most strongly associated input variables to perform analysis for different shapes is a machine learning-based regression model which will help us to predict the value of heating load and cooling load.
